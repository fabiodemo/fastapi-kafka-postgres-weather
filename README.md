# To-Do
- **Code Quality**:
  - [ ] Implementing unit tests for the codebase to ensure reliability and facilitate future development.
  - [ ] Applying consistent coding styles and adhering to best practices to improve readability and maintainability.

- **Infrastructure Optimization**:
  - [ ] Evaluating the performance of Docker containers and optimizing resource allocation as needed to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
  - [ ] Exploring container orchestration tools like Kubernetes for managing and scaling Dockerized applications more effectively.
  - [ ] Implementing monitoring and logging solutions to gain insights into the health and performance of the infrastructure and applications.

- **Data Pipeline Efficiency**:
  - [ ] Optimizing data retrieval and processing algorithms to minimize latency and improve throughput in the data pipeline.
  - [ ] Considering implementing caching mechanisms or data partitioning strategies to enhance data access speed and scalability.
  - [ ] Evaluating the use of streaming data processing frameworks like Apache Kafka Streams or Apache Flink for real-time analytics and processing.

- **Data Security**:
  - [ ] Implementing encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit within the data pipeline.
  - [ ] Implementing access control mechanisms to restrict data access to authorized users and roles, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
